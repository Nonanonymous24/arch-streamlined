Arch Linux quick install script 

### Inspired from
[Ermanno Ferrari](https://gitlab.com/eflinux/arch-basic)

## What is this script?

This is a simple [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) install script that provides a quick way to install the base system for Arch by assuming some common defaults and configuration options.
The aim is to provide a single script that would install the system in a single command for users who continuously install Arch for various purposes.

## What this script is not?

This script is not exactly designed for beginners and does not provide an interactive environment for the install.
For absolute beginners, try using the [archfi](https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi) script by [MatMoul](https://github.com/MatMoul) which provides an interactive installer and a bunch of different options to customize your install.
